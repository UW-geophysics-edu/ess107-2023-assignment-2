    "#### 1. Be able to summarize important statistics of a data set\n",
    "- Understand the distribution of observations over different lakes in the frozen lake dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Fit a basic machine learning model using this dataset\n",
    "- Conceptually understand the process of fitting a straight line\n",

    "1. Execute (shift-enter) each cell in this notebook in order.\n",
    "2. _Skim read_ each cell:  read over each line to get a sense of what is going on.  If you don't understand something, just keep going and note the context from the cell output.  We'll discuss the code in more detail verbally during the lab.\n",
    "3. Instructions that require you to do something (beyond just executing the cell) are written in **bold.**\n",

    "From [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Suwa):\n",
    "> Lake Suwa is the site of a natural phenomenon known as the \"God's Crossing\" (御神渡り, o-miwatari), large cracks that form in the winter across the surface of the frozen lake. A vertical temperature gradient results in ice pressure ridges forming in the surface ice, reaching heights of 30 centimetres (1 ft) or more.\n"
